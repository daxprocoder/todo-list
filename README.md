# todo-list
This project is a feature-rich To-Do application built using ReactJS. It goes beyond a basic task management app by integrating external APIs, implementing advanced state management with Redux, and ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience across devices. The app also includes a mock user authentication system to protect user data.
